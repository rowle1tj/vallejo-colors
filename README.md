There are two parts to this project, one is to scrape Vallejo's website for a color line and download samples of each color.  After the files have been downloaded once, the load_colors() can be called to create a dictionary of colors for comparison later.

The goal is to define an array of RGB values so I can figure out which Vallejo color is the closest to each target color to buy the paint!
